"""
Problem
    You want to sort objects of the same class, but they donâ€™t natively support comparison
    operations.

Solution
    The built-in sorted() function takes a key argument that can be passed a callable that
    will return some value in the object that sorted will use to compare the objects. For
    example, if you have a sequence of User instances in your application, and you want to
    sort them by their user_id attribute, you would supply a callable that takes a User
    instance as input and returns the user_id.

from operator import attrgetter


class User:
    def __init__(self, user_id):
        self.user_id = user_id

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"User({self.user_id})"


users = [User(32), User(3), User(99)]
print(users)

print(sorted(users, key=lambda u: u.user_id))

# Instead of using the lambda function, we can use attrgetter()
# We can also use multiple fields
print(sorted(users, key=attrgetter("user_id")))

# We can also use min() and max()
print(min(users, key=attrgetter("user_id")))
print(max(users, key=attrgetter("user_id")))
